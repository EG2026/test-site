    **[SGP Graduate School Program is now available!](/program)**
    
    ___
    
    The Symposium on Geometry Processing (SGP)  will co-locate in a joint event of the major conferences in applied geometry at
    the **[International Geometry Summit 2023 (IGS’23)](https://igs2023.imati.cnr.it/)**.  


    SGP is the premier venue for
    disseminating new research ideas and cutting-edge results in geometry
    processing. In this research area, concepts from mathematics, computer science,
    and engineering are studied and applied to offer new insights and design
    efficient algorithms for acquisition, modeling, analysis, manipulation,
    simulation and other types of processing of 3D models and shape collections.

    
    Continuing a successful tradition from previous years, SGP will also offer a 
    Graduate School, targeted at students and researchers new 
    to the field. Courses will be taught by leading experts and complemented by 
    interactive demonstrations to provide in-depth knowledge of recent and 
    fundamental aspects of geometry processing.

    Dear all,    
    
    
    in the end, we found a location for the SGP summer school in the city centre of Genoa, which is more comfortable to be reached by public transportation (particularly on Saturday and Sunday when the area of the city where the CNR is located is much less served by public transport).

    
    It is also within walking distance from the rest of the IGS event (and one stop from the underground).

    
    **The SGP will be located at the Bi.Bi Service - EventiGenova - Via XX Settembre, 41/3rd floor, 16121 Genova (GE)**
