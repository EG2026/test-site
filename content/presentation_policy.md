 Physical attendance in combination with appropriate presentation of accepted work is at the very heart of a scientific conference. This year, at EG26, we would like to make explicit what this entails, so that both authors and audience get the best experience and the integrity of scientific discussion is maintained. Hence,

1. · If authors of accepted work do not present in person the work will not be published. Remote presentation or pre-recorded material is not considered a presentation.
2. · At any rate, at least one co-author has to register.
3. · Exceptional circumstances, such as related to health or visa issues, might apply to 1., but require a formally documented case and approval by the Chairs / Track Chairs.
