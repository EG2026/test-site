The Eurographics 2025 Tutorials Committee invites you to propose tutorials teaching the technical background of a given subject or demonstrating its potential creative applications. Tutorials are intended to show what can be done, but even more importantly, how this is done and what kind of tools can be used to do it. In a proposal for a tutorial, you should consider that tutorial attendees come from diverse backgrounds, ranging from research and development to education and application.

We are soliciting half-day and full-day tutorial proposals at the beginning, intermediate, or advanced level in all areas pertinent to Computer Graphics. Half-day tutorials are about three hours, plus a coffee break in the middle. Full-day tutorials are twice that long, plus two coffee breaks and a longer lunch break. Full-day tutorials should be motivated by sufficient scientific material. Tutorial proposals are about 4-5 pages in length, clearly indicating the audience that is addressed as well as the syllabus of instruction. They will be reviewed by the tutorial chairs, supported by external reviewers. The final selection will be based on the quality of the submission, qualification of the presenters, relevance to the conference topics, and balance of topics.

Digital support materials of accepted tutorials will be made available to every Eurographics registered participant and included in the Eurographics digital library. Eurographics does not require copyright for the tutorial notes it publishes. The tutorial speakers may reuse their material freely. For each accepted tutorial, one free registration is provided per half-day of that tutorial.
