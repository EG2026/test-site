Join us at Eurographics 2026 for this new fishbowl-style discussion on sustainability in computer graphics, featuring leading voices from industry and research. Thereby, sustainability focuses on environmental aspects, i.e., addressing resource consumption and discussing how graphics technology can complement fields like environmental and climate research. In this open dialogue format, experts will share insights on (reducing) energy footprints and explore how our core research questions may evolve for a more environmentally cautious future. Together, we'll develop practical guidelines to inspire more sustainable practices in our community. Be part of the conversation that shapes a greener future in computer graphics â€” your ideas could spark the next breakthrough!
