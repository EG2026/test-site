The State-of-the-Art Reports (STARs) track at the Eurographics conference is a prestigious and integral component of the event, dedicated to providing comprehensive surveys on current and emerging topics in computer graphics. These reports synthesize recent advancements, significant research findings, and future directions in various subfields. STARs reports have a significant impact on the community, as evidenced by their high number of citations.

### Topics

We welcome submissions on all topics relevant to EUROGRAPHICS and particularly encourage STARs on subjects not covered in recent editions. STAR reports on cross-sectional, multidisciplinary areas are also highly encouraged. Additionally, a STAR can address the use of Computer Graphics techniques in different scientific disciplines or industrial practices. A list of recent STARs can be found on the websites of recent editions of the EUROGRAPHICS conference, such as those for [2025](https://diglib.eg.org/collections/c400c5c1-b64e-4618-8802-baf78ce50641), [2024](https://diglib.eg.org/collections/772434be-95f0-4c24-a23e-015e9bfed0cc), [2023](https://diglib.eg.org/communities/9cdc28cb-c390-4e85-9e6c-2653465ffa4f) and [2022](https://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.2312/2633168).

### Reviewing Process

Accepted STARs are published in a special issue of the Computer Graphics Forum, which appears right before the EUROGRAPHICS conference. The journal status of the proceedings requires a two-stage double-blind review process with conditional acceptance after the first round and final acceptance based on the revised submissions. Submissions needing a major revision will be transferred to the standard submission track of the Computer Graphics Forum.

---

### Submission Format

We do not impose strict maximum lengths for these submissions. However, it is recommended that papers be up to 20 pages excluding references and the authors’ short bios, to conform to the general recommendation for CGF survey papers. STARs must be formatted according to the [Eurographics Computer Graphics Forum guidelines](https://www.eg.org/wp/eurographics-publications/guidelines/) and submitted as anonymous papers. Furthermore, we follow the [arXiv Policy of the Full Paper Track](https://eg2026.github.io/call_for_full_papers/#call_for_full_papers). Violation of the anonymous policy or the formatting guideline may result in a desk rejection.

### Generative AI policy

Authors can utilize Generative AI tools to assist with grammar corrections while preparing their submissions. However, authors are responsible for any misrepresentation, factual inaccuracy, or plagiarism in their submission. Papers containing citations of non-existent material or obvious factual inaccuracies will be rejected when found, and may be rejected without review.

### How to Submit

Electronic submissions of STARs are mandatory and will be conducted using the Submission and Review Management System. Papers must be written in English and prepared according to this year’s template, which can be downloaded from the [Submission and Review Management (SRMv2)](https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/EG_2026STARs) system.

### If Accepted

At EUROGRAPHICS 2026, the authors of a STAR will be given 90 minutes to present the report at a level that allows non-experts in the particular domain to follow the presentation.
