Join us at Eurographics 2026 for an engaging discussion on mentorship in computer graphics, bringing together researchers and experts to explore the impact of mentorship on career growth, collaboration, and community building. This session will highlight best practices, address common challenges, and lay the groundwork for establishing a Eurographics Mentorship Programme. Whether you’re an experienced mentor, a mentee, or simply passionate about fostering a supportive research culture, your insights can help shape an initiative that strengthens our community. Be part of the conversation and help build a mentorship network that empowers the next generation of computer graphics researchers!

This year’s panel consists of 8 outstanding researchers who engage in initiatives promoting inclusion and equal access within the computer graphics community to ensure broader participation from underrepresented groups.
