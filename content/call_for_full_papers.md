### Reviewing Process & Upon Acceptance
All submissions will undergo a double-blind two-step review process; reviewer guidelines can be found [here](https://www.eg.org/wp/eurographics-publications/guidelines/#reviewer). Accepted full papers will be presented at the Eurographics 2026 conference and published in a special issue of the Eurographics journal [Computer Graphics Forum](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14678659) as well as the EG Digital Library. [Gold Open Access](https://www.eg.org/wp/eurographics-publications/guidelines/#licensing) will be available with an extra publication fee that includes open access fee and support through the EG Digital Library.

**At least one author needs to register and present in-person their paper**. Participants of Eurographics 2026 will be able to attend presentations of the latest advances in computer graphics and imaging from the research and industry experts. To get an overview over all Eurographics 2026 publications, and in addition to the standard paper presentations, there will be a fast forward session where each accepted paper is presented in around 25 seconds. Eurographics is also going to be a great opportunity to meet with international researchers in the domain and socialize around the conference social events.

---

### Submission Details

Electronic submission of all papers is mandatory and will be conducted using the [Submission and Review Management (SRMv2)](https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/EG_2026) platform. Papers must be written in English, must be anonymized, and must be formatted according to the Eurographics Computer Graphics Forum guidelines. The publication guidelines and LaTeX templates are available on [SRMv2](https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/EG_2026/Instruction). Accepted papers must be presented orally in English at Eurographics 2026. Review of full papers is based on a double-blind reviewing approach, so please be sure to remove all personal data (such as authors, affiliations, etc.) from your submission. References to your own work should be made in the third person to maintain anonymity. Reviewers are asked to keep confidential all materials sent to them for evaluation. More instructions for authors can be found [here](https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/EG_2026/Instruction).

There is no maximum length imposed on papers. However, papers should only be as long as they need to be, but not longer. Reviewers might rank submissions perceived as being either repetitive or unnecessarily long lower than they would score concisely written papers.

### Günter Enderle Best Paper Award and Best-of-Eurographics Session at SIGGRAPH 
From all accepted and presented papers, an international jury will select the best papers. The best paper will receive the [Günter Enderle Award](https://www.eg.org/wp/eurographics-awards-programme/other-eg-awards/2297-2/), including a cash prize of €1,000, presented at Eurographics 2026.
Starting 2025, we will have a Best-of-Eurographics session at SIGGRAPH. The authors of the best papers from Eurographics 2026 will have the opportunity to share their work at SIGGRAPH 2026 (ca. 20-minutes presentation). Eurographics will cover part of the registration/costs for this; more information on this will be provided in the future.

---

### Plagiarism

A submission to the Eurographics Full Papers program should describe the original work of the authors. Authors must not use ideas or content originating from others without properly crediting their original sources. Note that such sources are not limited to peer-reviewed publications but also include patents, textbooks, technical reports, theses, unpublished work posted on arXiv, and other posts on the World Wide Web. Failure to comply with this requirement will be considered plagiarism and result in rejection.

---

### Prior Art

Authors are expected to cite, discuss differences and novelty, and compare results, if applicable, with respect to relevant existing publications, provided they have been published in a peer-reviewed venue. This also applies to patents, which also undergo a professional reviewing process.

##### *What about non-peer-reviewed publications, such as technical reports or papers posted on arXiv?*

With the rapid progress of search engines and the increased perusal of arXiv papers by the scientific community, asking authors to thoroughly compare their work to these non-peer-reviewed pre-publications imposes an unreasonable burden — a seemingly relevant report that is incomplete in its disclosure or validation might appear online shortly before the deadline. Although peer-reviewed publications are certainly not immune to these shortcomings, they have, at least, been judged sufficiently complete and valid by a group of peers. Consequently, authors are not required to discuss and compare their work with recent non-peer-reviewed prepublications (arXiv, technical reports, theses, etc.), although they must properly cite those that inspired them (see “Plagiarism” above). Nevertheless, we encourage authors to mention all related works they are aware of as good academic practice dictates. Note that with new works posted on arXiv on a daily basis, it is increasingly likely that reviewers might point out similarities between the submitted work and online reports that have been missed by the authors. In this case, authors of conditionally accepted papers should be prepared to cite these pre-publications in their final revision as concurrent work, without the burden of having to detail how their work compares to or differs from these non-peer-reviewed pre-publications.

##### *What about citing own prior art?*

When authors cite previous work that they have authored (including any work where there is overlap between its author list and the author list of the present submission), the citation should be in the third person to preserve anonymity. There are, however, situations where such prior work should not be cited. This is the case if these prior works correspond to: (a) non-peer-reviewed prepublications of the submission (e.g., arXiv) with largely similar content (see also section on “arXiv Policy” below), or (b) prepublications with largely similar content (e.g., a poster that is not considered a publication). For (a), see section on “arXiv Policy” below. For (b), they should NOT be cited in the submission, as this would identify the authors. In both cases, these prepublications must be included in a text file and uploaded in the appropriate field of the submission form, as “Prepublications”. This information will not be visible to reviewers. 

---

### arXiv Policy

As authors, putting a submission on a repository like arXiv is allowed, either before submission or during the review cycle. There is no penalty for publishing a submission as a prepublication. However, if there are largely overlapping prepublications of the same authors that are available online at the time of submission (arXiv), earlier or largely similar versions of the submission should not be cited in the submission because this would identify the authors. This is consistent with the submission guidelines at SIGGRAPH and CVPR/ECCV/ICCV. After submission, the authors should try to preserve the anonymity of the submission. Specifically, the following list clarifies what is allowed and what not.

##### *Allowed:*

1. · arXiv postings before and after the submission deadline. Do not state that the submission is under review for Eurographics.
2. · YouTube video on personal account. Do not show submission id or anything that could relate to a Eurographics submission. Authors can link the videos from the arXiv page or personal web page.
3. · Code release on personal code repositories (e.g., github). Authors can link the code repository from the arXiv or personal web page.
4. · It is ok to list submissions in job applications and in interviews as long as they are not referred to as Eurographics submissions.
5. · It is ok to present the work in non-public venues in particular job talks as long as they are not referred to as Eurographics submissions.
6. · It is ok to list submissions on author’s webpages as long as they are not referred to as Eurographics submissions.
7. · It is ok to publicize the work via authors’ social media as long as they are not referred to as Eurographics submissions.

##### *Not allowed:*

1. · It is not allowed to list submissions on institutional websites irrespective of the presentation form.
2. · No publicity via university or company PR teams regardless of whether authors or institutions are kept anonymous – this includes any postings or dissemination via institutional or promoted social media accounts.
3. · No media interviews regardless of mainstream media or tech-focused outlets (small-scale, non-public seminars are allowed).
4. · Do not post papers or supplementary material on university, company, or other private servers that may identify preprints as Eurographics submissions.

### Double Submission Policy

By submitting a manuscript to the Eurographics Full Papers program, authors acknowledge that the technical contributions they claim have not been previously published or accepted for publication in another peer-reviewed venue and that no manuscript substantially similar in content is currently under review. Violations constitute grounds for rejection.

---

### Re-Submitted Material

For papers that have previously been reviewed by other venues and have been rejected or withdrawn, the authors are encouraged to provide a cover letter to describe the history of the paper (however, this does not imply reviewer continuity). This cover letter can also answer the comments made in the previous reviews, by either listing the changes that were made to comply with them or discussing/rebutting/clarifying some elements if need be. Though not mandatory, this procedure is strongly encouraged. The cover letter has to be submitted as "Additional Material" through SRM; please make sure you keep it anonymized.

---

### Human Subjects Data

If a paper makes use of data from human subjects, the collection and use of such data should have been conducted carefully and should adhere to ethical standards for responsible research practice, as well as data protection regulations. In many countries and institutions, the collection and use of personally identifiable data or data from human subjects is subject to approval from an Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board (IRB, or equivalent). If the use of such data was approved by an IRB, stating this is sufficient. If the use of such data has not (yet) been approved by an IRB, authors should provide information on any pending approval process, how the data was obtained, as well as discuss if and how consent was obtained (or why it, perhaps, could not be obtained). This discussion can be included either in the main paper or in the supplementary material. If the authors use an existing, published dataset, we encourage (but do not require) them to check how data was collected and whether consent was obtained. **These guidelines have been adapted from the ICCV 2025 Authors Guidelines.*

### Graphics Replicability Stamp Initiative

Authors who are willing to go one step further toward replicability of their contributed algorithm and provide a complete open-source implementation can get additional recognition via submission to the Graphics Replicability Stamp Initiative (see [http://www.replicabilitystamp.org/](http://www.replicabilitystamp.org/)). All articles published in the Computer Graphics Forum are eligible to apply for the stamp.
