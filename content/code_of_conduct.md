Eurographics is an inclusive and harassment-free conference that welcomes all participants independently of race, ethnicity, religion, citizenship, nationality, age, sexual or gender identity, disability, or any other characteristic protected by law in the location where Eurographics takes place. A respectful communication is vital for a healthy exchange of ideas and thoughts. Eurographics does not tolerate abuse or harassment in any form. Behaviors such as exclusion, intimidation, use of abusive or degrading language, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome sexual attention, and all other forms of harassment will face consequences.

Anyone who experiences, observes, or has knowledge of such behavior is requested to immediately report the incident to the chairs at eg2026@cs.rwth-aachen.de. The reports and all information will be kept confidential. Even in case a public response is deemed necessary, the identity of victims and reporters will remain confidential, unless those individuals consent otherwise.
