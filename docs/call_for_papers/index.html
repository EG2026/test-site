**[Registration for Conference and Graduate School is now open!](https://igs2023.imati.cnr.it/registration.html)**

**[The Marathon Hostel still has some places left if you are looking for accommodation](https://marathonhostel.com/en/)**

**[SGP Graduate School Program is now available!](/program)**
___
The Symposium on Geometry Processing (SGP)  will co-locate in a joint event of the major conferences in applied geometry at the **[International Geometry Summit 2023 (IGS’23)](https://igs2023.imati.cnr.it/)**.

SGP is the premier venue for disseminating new research ideas and cutting-edge results in geometry processing. In this research area, concepts from mathematics, computer science, and engineering are studied and applied to offer new insights and design efficient algorithms for acquisition, modeling, analysis, manipulation, simulation and other types of processing of 3D models and shape collections.

Continuing a successful tradition from previous years, SGP will also offer a Graduate School, targeted at students and researchers new to the field. Courses will be taught by leading experts and complemented by interactive demonstrations to provide in-depth knowledge of recent and fundamental aspects of geometry processing.
___
Dear all,

in the end, we found a location for the SGP summer school in the city centre of Genoa, which is more comfortable to be reached by public transportation (particularly on Saturday and Sunday when the area of the city where the CNR is located is much less served by public transport).

It is also within walking distance from the rest of the IGS event (and one stop from the underground).

**The SGP will be located at the Bi.Bi Service - EventiGenova - Via XX Settembre, 41/3rd floor, 16121 Genova (GE)**

<p>For its 47th edition, the <strong>EUROGRAPHICS 2026</strong> Full Papers Program will showcase innovative research in Computer Graphics and related areas. We invite submissions of new ideas and encourage all forms of research creativity and originality, with the ambition of setting the standard in the field and stimulating future trends. We encourage submissions from all areas related to Computer Graphics, including but not limited to: rendering, modeling, animation, generative AI, deep learning for graphics, simulation, geometry processing, image/video editing, fabrication, 3D printing, computational imaging, display technologies, graphics hardware, human-computer interaction, visualization, virtual and augmented reality.</p>
<p>In addition to novel methodologies and algorithms for Computer Graphics, EUROGRAPHICS welcomes submissions introducing new datasets and benchmarks, or documenting original perceptual and experimental studies that advance the field of Computer Graphics.</p>
<h3 id="reviewing-process--upon-acceptance">Reviewing Process &amp; Upon Acceptance</h3>
<p>All submissions will undergo a double-blind two-step review process. Accepted full papers will be presented at the Eurographics 2026 conference and published in a special issue of the Eurographics journal <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14678659">Computer Graphics Forum</a> as well as the EG Digital Library. <a href="https://www.eg.org/wp/eurographics-publications/guidelines/#licensing">Gold Open Access</a> will be available with an extra publication fee that includes open access fee and support through the EG Digital Library.</p>
<p><strong>At least one author needs to register and present in-person their paper</strong>. Participants of Eurographics 2026 will be able to attend presentations of the latest advances in computer graphics and imaging from the research and industry experts. To get an overview over all Eurographics 2026 publications, and in addition to the standard paper presentations, there will be a fast forward session where each accepted paper is presented in around 25 seconds. Eurographics is also going to be a great opportunity to meet with international researchers in the domain and socialize around the conference social events.</p>
<h3 id="submission-details">Submission Details</h3>
<p>Electronic submission of all papers is mandatory and will be conducted using the <a href="https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/EG_2026">Submission and Review Management (SRMv2)</a> platform. Papers must be written in English, must be anonymized, and must be formatted according to the Eurographics Computer Graphics Forum guidelines. The publication guidelines and LaTeX templates are available on <a href="https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/EG_2026/Instruction">SRMv2</a>. Accepted papers must be presented orally in English at Eurographics 2026. Review of full papers is based on a double-blind reviewing approach, so please be sure to remove all personal data (such as authors, affiliations, etc.) from your submission. References to your own work should be made in the third person to maintain anonymity. Reviewers are asked to keep confidential all materials sent to them for evaluation.</p>
<p>There is no maximum length imposed on papers. However, papers should only be as long as they need to be, but not longer. Reviewers might rank submissions perceived as being either repetitive or unnecessarily long lower than they would score concisely written papers.</p>
<h3 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h3>
<p>A submission to the Eurographics Full Papers program should describe the original work of the authors. Authors must not use ideas or content originating from others without properly crediting their original sources. Note that such sources are not limited to peer-reviewed publications but also include patents, textbooks, technical reports, theses, unpublished work posted on arXiv, and other posts on the World Wide Web. Failure to comply with this requirement will be considered plagiarism and result in rejection.</p>
<h3 id="prior-art">Prior Art</h3>
<p>Authors are expected to cite, discuss differences and novelty, and compare results, if applicable, with respect to relevant existing publications, provided they have been published in a peer-reviewed venue. This also applies to patents, which also undergo a professional reviewing process.</p>
<h5 id="what-about-non-peer-reviewed-publications-such-as-technical-reports-or-papers-posted-on-arxiv"><em>What about non-peer-reviewed publications, such as technical reports or papers posted on arXiv?</em></h5>
<p>With the rapid progress of search engines and the increased perusal of arXiv papers by the scientific community, asking authors to thoroughly compare their work to these non-peer-reviewed pre-publications imposes an unreasonable burden — a seemingly relevant report that is incomplete in its disclosure or validation might appear online shortly before the deadline. Although peer-reviewed publications are certainly not immune to these shortcomings, they have, at least, been judged sufficiently complete and valid by a group of peers. Consequently, authors are not required to discuss and compare their work with recent non-peer-reviewed prepublications (arXiv, technical reports, theses, etc.), although they must properly cite those that inspired them (see “Plagiarism” above). Nevertheless, we encourage authors to mention all related works they are aware of as good academic practice dictates. Note that with new works posted on arXiv on a daily basis, it is increasingly likely that reviewers might point out similarities between the submitted work and online reports that have been missed by the authors. In this case, authors of conditionally accepted papers should be prepared to cite these pre-publications in their final revision as concurrent work, without the burden of having to detail how their work compares to or differs from these non-peer-reviewed pre-publications.</p>
<h5 id="what-about-citing-own-prior-art"><em>What about citing own prior art?</em></h5>
<p>When authors cite previous work that they have authored (including any work where there is overlap between its author list and the author list of the present submission), the citation should be in the third person to preserve anonymity. There are, however, situations where such prior work should not be cited. This is the case if these prior works correspond to: (a) non-peer-reviewed prepublications of the submission (e.g., arXiv) with largely similar content (see also section on “arXiv Policy” below), or (b) prepublications with largely similar content (e.g., a poster that is not considered a publication). For (a), see section on “arXiv Policy” below. For (b), they should NOT be cited in the submission, as this would identify the authors. In both cases, these prepublications must be included in a text file and uploaded in the appropriate field of the submission form, as “Prepublications”. This information will be visible to IPC members but not to reviewers.</p>
<h3 id="arxiv-policy">arXiv Policy</h3>
<p>As authors, putting a submission on a repository like arXiv is allowed, either before submission or during the review cycle. There is no penalty for publishing a submission as a prepublication. However, if there are largely overlapping prepublications of the same authors that are available online at the time of submission (arXiv), earlier or largely similar versions of the submission should not be cited in the submission because this would identify the authors. This is consistent with the submission guidelines at SIGGRAPH and CVPR/ECCV/ICCV. After submission, the authors should try to preserve the anonymity of the submission. Specifically, the following list clarifies what is allowed and what not.</p>
<h5 id="allowed"><em>Allowed:</em></h5>
<p>arXiv postings before and after the submission deadline. Do not state that the submission is under review for Eurographics.</p>
<p>YouTube video on personal account. Do not show submission id or anything that could relate to a Eurographics submission. Authors can link the videos from the arXiv page or personal web page.</p>
<p>Code release on personal code repositories (e.g., github). Authors can link the code repository from the arXiv or personal web page.</p>
<p>It is ok to list submissions in job applications and in interviews as long as they are not referred to as Eurographics submissions.</p>
<p>It is ok to present the work in non-public venues in particular job talks as long as they are not referred to as Eurographics submissions.</p>
<p>It is ok to list submissions on author’s webpages as long as they are not referred to as Eurographics submissions.</p>
<p>It is ok to publicize the work via authors’ social media as long as they are not referred to as Eurographics submissions.</p>
<h5 id="not-allowed"><em>Not allowed:</em></h5>
<p>It is not allowed to list submissions on institutional websites irrespective of the presentation form.</p>
<p>No publicity via university or company PR teams regardless of whether authors or institutions are kept anonymous – this includes any postings or dissemination via institutional or promoted social media accounts.</p>
<p>No media interviews regardless of mainstream media or tech-focused outlets (small-scale, non-public seminars are allowed).</p>
<p>Do not post papers or supplementary material on university, company, or other private servers that may identify preprints as Eurographics submissions.</p>
<h3 id="double-submission-policy">Double Submission Policy</h3>
<p>By submitting a manuscript to the Eurographics Full Papers program, authors acknowledge that the technical contributions they claim have not been previously published or accepted for publication in another peer-reviewed venue and that no manuscript substantially similar in content is currently under review. Violations constitute grounds for rejection.</p>
<h3 id="re-submitted-material">Re-Submitted Material</h3>
<p>For papers that have previously been reviewed by other venues and have been rejected or withdrawn, the authors are encouraged to provide a cover letter to describe the history of the paper (however, this does not imply reviewer continuity). This cover letter can also answer the comments made in the previous reviews, by either listing the changes that were made to comply with them or discussing/rebutting/clarifying some elements if need be. Though not mandatory, this procedure is strongly encouraged. The cover letter has to be submitted through SRM as an “Additional Attachment” (see the last section of the SRM upload form for details).</p>
<h3 id="graphics-replicability-stamp-initiative">Graphics Replicability Stamp Initiative</h3>
<p>Authors who are willing to go one step further toward replicability of their contributed algorithm and provide a complete open-source implementation can get additional recognition via submission to the Graphics Replicability Stamp Initiative (see [http://www.replicabilitystamp.org/(http://www.replicabilitystamp.org/)]). All articles published in the Computer Graphics Forum are eligible to apply for the stamp.</p>
<h3 id="timeline-publication-and-prizes">Timeline, Publication and Prizes</h3>
<p>Please note that changes to the list of authors provided in the Submission Form are not allowed after the Submission Form deadline (September 22, 2025).</p>
<p>The reviews will be made available to the authors on November 19, 2025. During a rebuttal period from November 19 to November 26, 2025, authors will be able to submit a brief document to address any factual errors or clarify any issues raised by reviews.</p>
<p>The date for notification of the results of the first round of the review process is December 15, 2025.</p>
<p>Revised versions of papers conditionally accepted in the first round must be submitted by January 23, 2026.</p>
<p>The final notification of the outcome of the second reviewing round will be made on February 6, 2026.</p>
<p>The camera-ready version of accepted papers will be due on February 20, 2026.</p>
<p>From all accepted and presented papers, an international jury will select the best papers. The best paper will receive the Günter Enderle Award, presented at Eurographics 2026.</p>
