      <description>The Eurographics 2026 Tutorials Committee invites you to propose high-quality presentations and materials on the technical background of a given subject or demonstrating its potential creative applications. Tutorials are intended to show what can be done, but even more importantly, how this is done and what kind of tools can be used to do it. In a proposal for a tutorial, you should consider that tutorial attendees come from diverse backgrounds, ranging from research and development to education and application.</description>

      <description>(All following links to be updated)&#xA;Who Should Apply? PhD students working in all areas of computer graphics are encouraged to apply. We particularly encourage applications from students who are in the first half of their PhD work, especially those who already have a clear research direction (possibly with some published results), as they have sufficient time ahead to profit from their participation in the Doctoral Consortium. Students who are close to finishing their doctorate degree, or have very recently finished it, are also welcome to share their experience and to discuss their ongoing research and future research plans.</description>

      <guid>https://eg2026.github.io/test-site/presentation_policy/</guid>
      <description>Physical attendance in combination with appropriate presentation of accepted work is at the very heart of a scientific conference. This year, at EG26, we would like to make explicit what this entails, so that both authors and audience get the best experience and the integrity of scientific discussion is maintained. Hence,&#xA;· If authors of accepted work do not present in person the work will not be published. Remote presentation or pre-recorded material is not considered a presentation.</description>
