**[Registration for Conference and Graduate School is now open!](https://igs2023.imati.cnr.it/registration.html)**

**[The Marathon Hostel still has some places left if you are looking for accommodation](https://marathonhostel.com/en/)**

**[SGP Graduate School Program is now available!](/program)**
___
The Symposium on Geometry Processing (SGP)  will co-locate in a joint event of the major conferences in applied geometry at the **[International Geometry Summit 2023 (IGS’23)](https://igs2023.imati.cnr.it/)**.

SGP is the premier venue for disseminating new research ideas and cutting-edge results in geometry processing. In this research area, concepts from mathematics, computer science, and engineering are studied and applied to offer new insights and design efficient algorithms for acquisition, modeling, analysis, manipulation, simulation and other types of processing of 3D models and shape collections.

Continuing a successful tradition from previous years, SGP will also offer a Graduate School, targeted at students and researchers new to the field. Courses will be taught by leading experts and complemented by interactive demonstrations to provide in-depth knowledge of recent and fundamental aspects of geometry processing.
___
Dear all,

in the end, we found a location for the SGP summer school in the city centre of Genoa, which is more comfortable to be reached by public transportation (particularly on Saturday and Sunday when the area of the city where the CNR is located is much less served by public transport).

It is also within walking distance from the rest of the IGS event (and one stop from the underground).

**The SGP will be located at the Bi.Bi Service - EventiGenova - Via XX Settembre, 41/3rd floor, 16121 Genova (GE)**

<p>(All following links to be updated)</p>
<p>The State-of-the-Art Reports (STARs) track at the Eurographics conference is a prestigious and integral component of the event, dedicated to providing comprehensive surveys on current and emerging topics in computer graphics. These reports synthesize recent advancements, significant research findings, and future directions in various subfields. STARs reports have a significant impact on the community, as evidenced by their high number of citations.</p>

<h3 id="topics">Topics</h3>
<p>We welcome submissions on all topics relevant to EUROGRAPHICS and particularly encourage STARs on subjects not covered in recent editions. STAR reports on cross-sectional, multidisciplinary areas are also highly encouraged. Additionally, a STAR can address the use of Computer Graphics techniques in different scientific disciplines or industrial practices. A list of recent STARs can be found on the websites of recent editions of the EUROGRAPHICS conference, such as those for <a href="https://diglib.eg.org/collections/772434be-95f0-4c24-a23e-015e9bfed0cc">2024</a>, <a href="https://diglib.eg.org/collections/c7ec898d-60d1-4f6a-9367-de58a2104b7f">2023</a> and <a href="https://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.2312/2633168">2022</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="reviewing-process">Reviewing Process</h3>
<p>Accepted STARs are published in a special issue of the Computer Graphics Forum, which appears right before the EUROGRAPHICS conference. The journal status of the proceedings requires a two-stage review process with conditional acceptance after the first round and final acceptance based on the revised submissions. Submissions needing a major revision will be transferred to the standard submission track of the Computer Graphics Forum.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="submission-format">Submission Format</h3>
<p>We do not impose strict maximum lengths for these submissions. However, it is recommended that papers be up to 20 pages excluding references and the authors’ short bios, to conform to the general recommendation for CGF survey papers. STARs must be formatted according to the <a href="https://www.eg.org/wp/eurographics-publications/guidelines/">Eurographics Computer Graphics Forum guidelines</a> and submitted as anonymous papers.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="how-to-submit">How to Submit</h3>
<p>Electronic submissions of STARs are mandatory and will be conducted using the Submission and Review Management System. Papers must be written in English and prepared according to this year’s template, which can be downloaded from the <a href="https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/EG_2025STARs">Submission and Review Management (SRMv2)</a> system.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="if-accepted">If Accepted</h3>
<p>At EUROGRAPHICS 2026, the authors of a STAR will be given 90 minutes to present the report at a level that allows non-experts in the particular domain to follow the presentation.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="arxiv-policy">arXiv Policy</h3>
<p>Please refer to the <a href="https://eg25.cs.ucl.ac.uk/main/arxiv-policy.html">Eurographics 2025 arXiv Policy</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="double-submission-policy">Double Submission Policy</h3>
<p>By submitting a manuscript to the Eurographics Full Papers program, authors acknowledge that the technical contributions they claim have not been previously published or accepted for publication in another peer-reviewed venue and that no manuscript substantially similar in content is currently under review. Violations constitute grounds for rejection.</p>
