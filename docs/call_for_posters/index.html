**[Registration for Conference and Graduate School is now open!](https://igs2023.imati.cnr.it/registration.html)**

**[The Marathon Hostel still has some places left if you are looking for accommodation](https://marathonhostel.com/en/)**

**[SGP Graduate School Program is now available!](/program)**
___
The Symposium on Geometry Processing (SGP)  will co-locate in a joint event of the major conferences in applied geometry at the **[International Geometry Summit 2023 (IGS’23)](https://igs2023.imati.cnr.it/)**.

SGP is the premier venue for disseminating new research ideas and cutting-edge results in geometry processing. In this research area, concepts from mathematics, computer science, and engineering are studied and applied to offer new insights and design efficient algorithms for acquisition, modeling, analysis, manipulation, simulation and other types of processing of 3D models and shape collections.

Continuing a successful tradition from previous years, SGP will also offer a Graduate School, targeted at students and researchers new to the field. Courses will be taught by leading experts and complemented by interactive demonstrations to provide in-depth knowledge of recent and fundamental aspects of geometry processing.
___
Dear all,

in the end, we found a location for the SGP summer school in the city centre of Genoa, which is more comfortable to be reached by public transportation (particularly on Saturday and Sunday when the area of the city where the CNR is located is much less served by public transport).

It is also within walking distance from the rest of the IGS event (and one stop from the underground).

**The SGP will be located at the Bi.Bi Service - EventiGenova - Via XX Settembre, 41/3rd floor, 16121 Genova (GE)**

<h2 id=call_for_posters>Call for Posters</h2>
<div id=simple-static></div>
<p>(All following links to be updated)</p>
<p>Authors are invited to submit proposals for poster presentations of recent results, work in progress, new ideas, and other smaller projects which may be of interest to the general community, but which are still too speculative, incomplete or not of sufficient extent to warrant a (full or short) paper. We encourage submissions from all areas related to computer graphics, such as rendering, modeling, visualization, perception, animation, simulation, virtual reality, and imaging. Submissions from computer vision and machine learning areas are also invited to the Posters track. The Posters track provides young researchers, especially postgraduate students, with valuable opportunities to receive feedback from other researchers and engage in stimulating discussions. One or more authors of accepted posters are expected to be physically present at the conference, to discuss their work and answer questions during the poster session. Accepted posters and the final papers will be included in the digital media with the proceedings and other material.</p>

</code></pre><hr>
<h3 id="submission-details">Submission Details</h3>
<p>We solicit poster submissions in the form of a sketch, i.e., an extended abstract of at most 2 pages (including references), formatted according to the Eurographics Author’s guidelines. We encourage the submission of additional materials. For example, you can submit an additional PDF (without any page limit) that contains a number of example results, screenshots, an interaction sequence, etc. The poster draft itself can also be added as additional material (not mandatory for the initial submission, but mandatory for eventual camera-ready submission of accepted posters). Finally, submissions can also include supplementary material such as videos or executable programs.</p>
<p>Submissions shall be anonymous and made through the <a href="https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/EG_2025P">Eurographics Submission and Review Management (SRMv2) System</a> and subject to a review process.</p>
<p>The authors of accepted posters are expected to provide:</p>
<ol>
<li>· a poster in A0 portrait format (download the EG2025 poster template <a href="https://eg25.cs.ucl.ac.uk/resources/EG25-poster-template.pptx">here</a>), with a resolution of at least 9933 x 14043 pixels</li>
<li>· a final 2-page paper describing the poster content</li>
</ol>
<p>Both a PDF version of the poster and the extended abstract will be included in the EG digital library with a DOI. The material in a poster/sketch can later be reused by the original authors for a more extensive publication (e.g., a full paper) with more detailed content and mature results, without being considered self-plagiarism.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="formatting-details">Formatting Details</h3>
<p>To submit to Eurographics 2025 Posters, authors prepare their submission as a 2-page PDF file (“sketch”) using the LaTeX template available on SRMv2. On Overleaf, this template can be imported easily by selecting “New Project” -&gt; “Upload Project” and uploading the zip file. Select EGauthorGuidelines-<em>poster</em>.tex﻿ as the main document of the project and use it for your submission.</p>
<p>Please make sure that an image embedded in your poster sketch does not contain transparent pixels (i.e., an alpha channel of a transparent color) because this will lead to problems when the resulting PDF is displayed or printed.</p>
<p>Submissions can also include supplementary material such as videos or executable programs. The server will accept uploads of at most 200 MB, so multiple files of over 200 MB must be submitted separately. We encourage the use of digital videos to support poster submissions, particularly if part of, or all of the work covers interactive techniques. Please use only the most common video codecs (e.g., MP4 format using the H.264 codec) to maximize the chances that the reviewers can see it. A poster draft can itself be added as additional material but is not mandatory for the initial submission (it is mandatory for the camera-ready submission of accepted posters, though). The final posters should be printed on paper no larger than paper size A0 portrait (84.1cm x 118.9cm = 33.1in x 46.8in, cf. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size</a>).</p>
<p>Contributions must be written and presented in English.</p>
