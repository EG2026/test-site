**[Registration for Conference and Graduate School is now open!](https://igs2023.imati.cnr.it/registration.html)**

**[The Marathon Hostel still has some places left if you are looking for accommodation](https://marathonhostel.com/en/)**

**[SGP Graduate School Program is now available!](/program)**
___
The Symposium on Geometry Processing (SGP)  will co-locate in a joint event of the major conferences in applied geometry at the **[International Geometry Summit 2023 (IGS’23)](https://igs2023.imati.cnr.it/)**.

SGP is the premier venue for disseminating new research ideas and cutting-edge results in geometry processing. In this research area, concepts from mathematics, computer science, and engineering are studied and applied to offer new insights and design efficient algorithms for acquisition, modeling, analysis, manipulation, simulation and other types of processing of 3D models and shape collections.

Continuing a successful tradition from previous years, SGP will also offer a Graduate School, targeted at students and researchers new to the field. Courses will be taught by leading experts and complemented by interactive demonstrations to provide in-depth knowledge of recent and fundamental aspects of geometry processing.
___
Dear all,

in the end, we found a location for the SGP summer school in the city centre of Genoa, which is more comfortable to be reached by public transportation (particularly on Saturday and Sunday when the area of the city where the CNR is located is much less served by public transport).

It is also within walking distance from the rest of the IGS event (and one stop from the underground).

**The SGP will be located at the Bi.Bi Service - EventiGenova - Via XX Settembre, 41/3rd floor, 16121 Genova (GE)**

<h2 id=doctoral_consortium>Doctoral Consortium</h2>
<div id=simple-static></div>
<p>(All following links to be updated)</p>
<h3 id="who-should-apply">Who Should Apply?</h3>
<p>PhD students working in all areas of computer graphics are encouraged to apply. We particularly encourage applications from students who are in the first half of their PhD work, especially those who already have a clear research direction (possibly with some published results), as they have sufficient time ahead to profit from their participation in the Doctoral Consortium. Students who are close to finishing their doctorate degree, or have very recently finished it, are also welcome to share their experience and to discuss their ongoing research and future research plans.</p>
<p>The applicants are strongly encouraged to consider submitting a poster of their work to the poster track in parallel.</p>

<h3 id="submission-guidelines">Submission Guidelines</h3>
<p>Submission website: <a href="https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/EG_2025DC">Eurographics Submission and Review Management (SRM) system</a>.</p>
<p>Template: The format should be in accordance with Eurographics Author’s guidelines.</p>
<p>Eligible Doctoral Consortium students who would like to participate in the Doctoral Consortium should submit the following documents as a single PDF file:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Research Statement: A 3-4 pages extended abstract summarizing their dissertation research, singly authored by themself. The submissions should NOT be anonymous. The use of figures is encouraged. This document should include:</p>
<ol>
<li>· university doctoral program context (e.g.program duration/funding) in which the work is being conducted, including starting date and expected graduation date;</li>
<li>· motivation that drives the dissertation research;</li>
<li>· research objectives/questions;</li>
<li>· background and related work that informs the author’s research;</li>
<li>· research approach, methodology and proposed experiments (where appropriate);</li>
<li>· dissertation status and a description of the remaining work;</li>
<li>· current and expected contributions.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The research statement should transcend the scope of a single publication or project, and instead focus on the general research theme or agenda for the student’s PhD thesis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supervisor’s letter of support: A one-page signed letter from the PhD student’s supervisor, supporting her/his participation in the Doctoral Consortium, and providing the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>the student’s status with respect to the institution’s PhD requirements;</li>
<li>the expected date of thesis/dissertation defense or graduation;</li>
<li>why attendance at this Doctoral Consortium would be particularly beneficial to the student;</li>
<li>what contributions the student is likely to make to the event if invited to attend.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Curriculum vitae: A 1-2 pages CV plus the list of all publications.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All three documents must be written in English.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="review-process">Review Process</h3>
<p>The review process is single-anonymous. The review and decision of acceptance will take into account:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Quality of the submission (potential contribution and impact of the research to the field of computer graphics) and the author’s stage of doctoral research;</li>
<li>· the benefits of the consortium for the author’s PhD research;</li>
<li>· the author’s contribution to the diversity of topics, backgrounds and profiles that will integrate the Consortium.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each accepted author will be paired with a panelist, a senior researcher in their research field, with whom they will be interacting in a one-to-one manner.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="participation">Participation</h3>
<p>All authors of accepted submissions are expected to attend the Doctoral Consortium, where they will present their work to a panel of experts, selected by the Doctoral Consortium co-chairs to match at best the topics related to the accepted submissions.</p>
<p>The doctoral consortium event will be a closed event with only the authors and the panelists present. The authors will start by presenting their work (around 10 minutes each) followed by discussion with the panelists and other authors. Afterwards, there will be time for one-to-one discussions between each author and their paired panelist.</p>
